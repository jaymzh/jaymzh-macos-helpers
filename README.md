# MacOS stuff

I'm forced to use a Mac at work, here's where I put
stuff I do to make it more tolerable.

* [karabiner](karabiner/README.md) - Karabiner-Elements is opensource software for Mac that allows you to defined keybindings and keymappings. I include my custom ones here which are probably modifiable by most people to suit their needs.
* [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/) - Moom allows you to save window layouts and easily return to them which can making life much easier.
